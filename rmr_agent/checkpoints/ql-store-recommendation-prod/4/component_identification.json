There is no overlap with the driver creation line ranges.\n\nFULL ML PIPELINE FILE LIST:\n['rmr_agent/repos/ql-store-recommendation-prod/research/pipeline/00_driver.py', 'rmr_agent/repos/ql-store-recommendation-prod/research/pipeline/01_bq_feat.py', 'rmr_agent/repos/ql-store-recommendation-prod/research/pipeline/01_varmart_feat.py', 'rmr_agent/repos/ql-store-recommendation-prod/research/pipeline/02_combine.py', 'rmr_agent/repos/ql-store-recommendation-prod/research/pipeline/03_prepare_training_data.py', 'rmr_agent/repos/ql-store-recommendation-prod/research/pipeline/04_training.py', 'rmr_agent/repos/ql-store-recommendation-prod/research/pipeline/05_scoring_oot.py', 'rmr_agent/repos/ql-store-recommendation-prod/research/pipeline/06_evaluation.py']\n\nCURRENT FILE'S NAME:\n06_evaluation.ipynb\n\nCURRENT FILE'S CODE SUMMARY:\n**Load model version and set up directories (Lines 4-12):**\n- Loads the current model version from a file.\n- Sets up paths for model artifacts and evaluation readouts.\n- Creates the evaluation readout directory if it doesn't exist.\n\n**Load configuration from YAML file (Lines 13-25):**\n- Defines a function to load YAML files.\n- Loads the base configuration from a specified YAML file.\n- Extracts the BigQuery project dataset prefix from the configuration.\n\n**Create driver_oot_txn_365d table (Lines 26-46):**\n- Drops the existing `driver_oot_txn_365d` table if it exists.\n- Creates a new `driver_oot_txn_365d` table by joining `driver_oot` with transaction data to get the last purchase timestamp.\n\n**Create driver_oot_txn_save_365d table (Lines 47-67):**\n- Drops the existing `driver_oot_txn_save_365d` table if it exists.\n- Creates a new `driver_oot_txn_save_365d` table by joining `driver_oot_txn_365d` with save event data to get the last save date.\n\n**Create mlv2_gpt_similar_map_snapshot table (Lines 68-139):**\n- Drops the existing `mlv2_gpt_similar_map_snapshot` table if it exists.\n- Creates a new `mlv2_gpt_similar_map_snapshot` table by joining similar merchant map data with live unique merchants.\n\n**Create mlv2_gpt_similar_map_snapshot_1 table (Lines 140-195):**\n- Drops the existing `mlv2_gpt_similar_map_snapshot_1` table if it exists.\n- Creates a new `mlv2_gpt_similar_map_snapshot_1` table by concatenating and splitting similar merchant IDs into separate columns.\n\n**Create driver_oot_txn_save_365d_similar table (Lines 196-208):**\n- Drops the existing `driver_oot_txn_save_365d_similar` table if it exists.\n- Creates a new `driver_oot_txn_save_365d_similar` table by joining `driver_oot_txn_save_365d` with `mlv2_gpt_similar_map_snapshot_1` to get similar merchants.\n\n**Create driver_oot_txn_save_365d_similar_dedup table (Lines 209-248):**\n- Drops the existing `driver_oot_txn_save_365d_similar_dedup` table if it exists.\n- Creates a new `driver_oot_txn_save_365d_similar_dedup` table by deduplicating similar merchants and ranking them.\n\n**Create driver_oot_two_tower_similar_score table (Lines 249-337):**\n- Drops the existing `driver_oot_two_tower_similar_score` table if it exists.\n- Creates a new `driver_oot_two_tower_similar_score` table by calculating dot product scores between customer and merchant embeddings.\n\n**Create driver_oot_hueristic_model_comparison table (Lines 338-373):**\n- Drops the existing `driver_oot_hueristic_model_comparison` table if it exists.\n- Creates a new `driver_oot_hueristic_model_comparison` table by comparing heuristic model scores and ranks.\n\n**Calculate recall metrics and save performance data (Lines 375-446):**\n- Calculates recall metrics for different models and saves the results to a CSV file.\n- Plots the performance metrics and saves the plot as an image.\n\n**Calculate recall metrics for specific merchant category and save performance data (Lines 448-530"
