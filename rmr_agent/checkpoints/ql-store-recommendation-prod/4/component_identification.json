Training involves fitting the model to the data, while packaging involves preparing the trained model for deployment. These steps are sequential but separate, warranting distinct workflow nodes.\n\n[Model Scoring]:\n- Line Range: Lines 230-268\n- Evidence:\n    - \"Prepare test data and make predictions using the final model\" \u2013 This indicates the use of the trained model to make predictions on test data, which is part of model scoring.\n    - \"Run inference with ONNX model\" \u2013 This describes the process of using the ONNX model for inference, which is a key aspect of model scoring.\n\n- Why This Is Separate: \n    - Verification of ZERO overlap with other components' line ranges: The lines for model scoring (230-268) do not overlap with the lines for model training (140-170) or model packaging (171-227).\n    - Justification for why this should be split from the other code: Model scoring is a distinct step that involves using the trained and packaged model to make predictions on new data. This step is separate from both training and packaging, as it focuses on the application of the model rather than its development or preparation for deployment.\n\nFULL ML PIPELINE FILE LIST:\n['rmr_agent/repos/ql-store-recommendation-prod/research/pipeline/00_driver.py', 'rmr_agent/repos/ql-store-recommendation-prod/research/pipeline/01_bq_feat.py', 'rmr_agent/repos/ql-store-recommendation-prod/research/pipeline/01_varmart_feat.py', 'rmr_agent/repos/ql-store-recommendation-prod/research/pipeline/02_combine.py', 'rmr_agent/repos/ql-store-recommendation-prod/research/pipeline/03_prepare_training_data.py', 'rmr_agent/repos/ql-store-recommendation-prod/research/pipeline/04_training.py', 'rmr_agent/repos/ql-store-recommendation-prod/research/pipeline/05_scoring_oot.py', 'rmr_agent/repos/ql-store-recommendation-prod/research/pipeline/06_evaluation.py']\n\nCURRENT FILE'S NAME:\n04_training.ipynb\n\nCURRENT FILE'S CODE SUMMARY:\n**[Import necessary libraries and modules] (Lines 2-11):**\n- Import essential libraries and modules such as TensorFlow, pandas, numpy, and deepctr.\n\n**[Configure GPU settings] (Lines 12-14):**\n- List available GPUs and set memory growth to true for each GPU.\n\n**[Load YAML configuration file] (Lines 15-23):**\n- Define a function to load a YAML file and load the configuration from a specified path.\n\n**[Load model version and create directories] (Lines 24-34):**\n- Load the current model version from a pickle file and create necessary directories for storing model artifacts.\n\n**[Load and concatenate parquet files] (Lines 36-43):**\n- List all parquet files in a specified directory, read them into pandas DataFrames, and concatenate them into a single DataFrame.\n\n**[Load feature encoders and tokenizers] (Lines 44-47):**\n- Load categorical feature encoders and a tokenizer for receiver IDs from pickle files.\n\n**[Split data into training and validation sets] (Lines 48-49):**\n- Split the concatenated data into training and validation sets based on a 'split' column.\n\n**[Define numeric, receiver ID, and categorical feature names] (Lines 52-74):**\n- Define lists of numeric feature names, receiver ID names, and categorical feature names.\n\n**[Define function to prepare input features and labels] (Lines 75-106):**\n- Define a function to prepare input features and labels for the model, including creating feature columns and extracting feature names.\n\n**[Prepare training and validation data] (Lines 107-109):**\n- Prepare training and validation data using the defined function.\n\n**[Define data generator function] (Lines 110-120):**\n- Define a generator function to yield batches of data for training and validation.\n\n**[Create training and validation datasets] (Lines 121-137):**\n- Create TensorFlow datasets for training and validation using the data generator function.\n\n**[Define and compile the model] (Lines 140-155):**\n- Define and compile the DIN model within a distributed strategy scope, using parameters from the configuration file.\n\n**[Set up early stopping callback and train the model] (Lines 156-170):**\n- Set up an early stopping callback and train the model using the training and validation datasets.\n\n**[Save the trained model] (Lines 171-175):**\n- Save the trained model in both H5 and TensorFlow SavedModel formats.\n\n**[Convert TensorFlow model to ONNX format] (Lines 176-186):**\n- Convert the TensorFlow model to ONNX format and save the ONNX specification.\n\n**[Create directories for out-of-time scoring] (Lines 188-189):**\n- Create directories for out-of-time scoring if they do not exist.\n\n**[Filter non-ASCII keys in categorical encoders] (Lines 196-204):**\n- Filter out non-ASCII keys from categorical feature encoders.\n\n**[Load numerical feature scalars] (Lines 205-206):**\n- Load numerical feature scalars from a pickle file.\n\n**[Build ONNX graph and save the model] (Lines 207-227):**\n- Build an ONNX graph using the model and feature transformations, then save the final ONNX model.\n\n**[Prepare test data and make predictions] (Lines 230-239):**\n- Prepare test data and make predictions using the final model.\n\n**[Save test data to JSON file] (Lines 240-248):**\n- Save the prepared test data to a JSON file.\n\n**[Convert TensorFlow model to ONNX format using tf2onnx] (Lines 251-253):**\n- Convert the TensorFlow model to ONNX format using the tf2onnx library.\n\n**[Run inference with ONNX model] (Lines 254-268):**\n- Load the ONNX model and run inference, comparing results with the TensorFlow model to ensure consistency.",
